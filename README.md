## Acquiring Free API Key

Next step is getting a free API key at [News API](https://newsapi.org/) witch will help us make some call requests to the server and retrieve the news articles. 

Once the api key is in your hands, go to `/src/app/news-api.service.ts` and paste it to where it said put “PUT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE”.

## Installing dependencies

After the downloading the repository head on to the project root folder and run the `npm install` command line.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
